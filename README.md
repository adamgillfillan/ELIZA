ELIZA
=====

Eliza is an amusing interpretation of an agent that simulates a Rogerian psychologist.

Eliza: Hi, my name is Eliza. I am a Rogerian psychologist.
Eliza: Today I will help you with your problems.
Eliza: What is your name?
Adam
Eliza: What is wrong, Adam?
Adam: Nothing is wrong.
Eliza: NOTHING IS WRONG
Adam: Men are all alike.
Eliza: IN WHAT WAY
Adam: They are always acting so cool.
Eliza: CAN YOU COME UP WITH JUST ONE TIME THIS HAPPENED
Adam: This one time when I was sad, my dad helped me out.
Eliza: SUCK IT UP KID
Adam: I did, dad helped.
Eliza: GREAT, I'LL TELL YOUR DAD WHEN WE ARE DONE HERE
Adam: You are making me feel depressed.
Eliza: I BET YOUR MOM CARES
Adam: Ok, now I am angry.
Eliza: DO YOU NEED A WALL TO PUNCH
Adam: Yes, I do.
Eliza: YES YOU DO
